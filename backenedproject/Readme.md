                                        What is CORS?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain (origin) than the one that served the web page.

For example:

If your frontend runs at: http://localhost:3000

And your backend runs at: http://localhost:5000

By default, the browser blocks requests from the frontend to the backend unless the backend explicitly allows it.

The cors module helps you configure your backend server to allow requests from specific origins.
